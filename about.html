<p>My name is Emily and I'm a writer and developer with a passion for explaining technical concepts in non-technical ways. My goal in this blog is to investigate questions that pop up for me on this learning journey, and to explain them in a way that might make sense to a broad range people who may not yet dream in code.   </p>
